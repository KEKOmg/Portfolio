# 📱 iOS Developer Portfolio

Hi! My name is Uladzislau, and I’m an iOS developer passionate about building clean, adaptive, and animated apps using **Swift** and **UIKit**.

I build all UI programmatically with Auto Layout, follow MVVM + Coordinator architecture, and enjoy working with APIs and animation.
